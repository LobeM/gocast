# gocast

A podcast app built using flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is an app that can be deployed on iOS and Android. BLOC (Business Logic Component) state management was set up to separate the business logic from the UI. Flutter localization was added to allow the app to easily be deployed to users who speak another language.
