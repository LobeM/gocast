This episode is a gift to you all for being the greatest. I often see these comments from every 20 something year old trying to seek clarity or asking me how I did what I did. Here‚Äôs a glimpse at my journey from my childhood to adulthood. I grew up in an extremely spiritual family which led me to the most powerful spiritual person at a very young age. Although I had a shadow of spirituality, the external world got me to some very bad times growing up. Alcohol, Marijuana, teachers insulting me because I was a fitness freak and a lot more but through the power of manifestation and the power of self-belief, I got here and created this magnificent channel and podcast. 100th episode of The Ranveer Show, answering the most asked question, how to seek clarity and achieve whatever you want in life.",
